## Course material

Assuming you have git installed locally, you can check out the entire set of course materials with the following command (from command line):
```
git clone https://github.com/sta426hs2024/material.git
```
and get updates by running `git pull` at any later time in the same directory.

Alternatively, to retrieve a ZIP file of the repository, you can click on the (green) 'Code' button (top right of main panel) and then click 'Download ZIP'.
